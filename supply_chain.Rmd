## packages

```{r packages,results="hide",message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}

# Libraries
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

```

## Generating Data

```{r generate,}

# Generate demand forecasts 
set.seed(123)
routes <- c("Route A", "Route B", "Route C")
months <- c("Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun")
demand_data <- data.frame(
  Route = sample(routes, 100, replace = TRUE),
  Month = sample(months, 100, replace = TRUE),
  Demand = round(rnorm(100, mean = 100, sd = 20))
)

# Generate operational costs 
fuel_cost <- rnorm(length(routes), mean = 2, sd = 0.2)  # fuel cost per mile/km
labor_cost <- rnorm(length(routes), mean = 20, sd = 5)   # labor cost per hour
maintenance_cost <- rnorm(length(routes), mean = 500, sd = 100)  # maintenance cost per vehicle

operational_costs <- data.frame(
  Route = routes,
  Fuel_Cost = fuel_cost,
  Labor_Cost = labor_cost,
  Maintenance_Cost = maintenance_cost
)

# Example route capacities and constraints (static data)
route_capacities <- data.frame(
  Route = routes,
  Capacity_Tons = c(20, 30, 25),  # Example capacity in tons
  Capacity_Volume = c(100, 150, 120)  # Example capacity in cubic meters
)

```

## Demand Analysis

```{r demand analysis,warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

# Convert Month to a factor with the levels in the correct order
demand_data$Month <- factor(demand_data$Month, levels = c("Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun"))

# Summary statistics for demand per route
demand_summary <- demand_data %>%
  group_by(Route) %>%
  summarise(
    Mean_Demand = mean(Demand),
    Median_Demand = median(Demand),
    SD_Demand = sd(Demand),
    Total_Demand = sum(Demand)
  )

print(demand_summary)

# Monthly demand trends for each route
monthly_demand <- demand_data %>%
  group_by(Route, Month) %>%
  summarise(Total_Demand = sum(Demand))

# Plot monthly demand trends
ggplot(monthly_demand, aes(x = Month, y = Total_Demand, color = Route, group = Route)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.2) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  labs(title = "Monthly Demand Trends per Route",
       x = "Month",
       y = "Total Demand") +
  theme_minimal()

```

## Operational Cost Analysis

```{r operational cost analysis,}

# Calculate total operational costs per route
operational_costs <- operational_costs %>%
  mutate(Total_Cost = Fuel_Cost + Labor_Cost + Maintenance_Cost)

print(operational_costs)

# Plot total costs per route
ggplot(operational_costs, aes(x = Route, y = Total_Cost, fill = Route)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Total Operational Costs per Route",
       x = "Route",
       y = "Total Cost") +
  theme_minimal()

```

## Capacity Utilization Analysis

```{r capacity utilization analysis,}

# Join demand data with route capacities
capacity_utilization <- demand_summary %>%
  left_join(route_capacities, by = "Route") %>%
  mutate(
    Utilization_Tons = (Total_Demand / Capacity_Tons) * 100,  # Utilization in percentage
    Utilization_Volume = (Total_Demand / Capacity_Volume) * 100
  )

print(capacity_utilization)

# Plot capacity utilization
ggplot(capacity_utilization, aes(x = Route)) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = Utilization_Tons, fill = "Tons"), stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  geom_bar(aes(y = Utilization_Volume, fill = "Volume"), stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Capacity Utilization per Route (Tons vs Volume)",
       x = "Route",
       y = "Utilization (%)") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Tons" = "blue", "Volume" = "red")) +
  theme_minimal()

```
